#### **Branding and website: Muslim Marine**

I created and a maintain [a website](http://muslimmarine.org) on Squarespace for a client looking to make media appearances showing his unique perspective on patriotism as a Muslim veteran. I also designed branded graphic elements including his logo, Twitter header and print letterhead. He has since been featured by the New York Times, the BBC, MSNBC, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, Voice of America, BuzzFeed and more leading news outlets.

#### **Social media: Religion News Service**

I worked as the social media editor at Religion News Service, a daily news wire service based in D.C., during 2016. I worked with the Reynolds Journalism Center as part of their research into methods of building social trust with readers, and I helped the newsroom tweak its Instagram stategy and begin posting longform and more visual stories on Medium. I coordinated posting and growth strategy on Facebook (where we had 23k+ likes), Twitter (60k+ followers) and other platforms like Pinterest. My work doubled our average daily Facebook reach and monthly tweet impressions, and multiplied our daily tweet clickthrough rate by about 1.5.

#### **Website: Spiritual Fitness**

I created and maintain a Wordpress website for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community's national [Spiritual Fitness project](http://spiritualfitness.us). I also created all the graphic elements there and write most of the site's copy, part of the branding work I led there. I also lead the project's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/spiritualfit) for several years, bringing the follower count from 0 to well over 1,500 users.

#### **Website: aysha.us**

After years of using Wordpress and a handcoded HTML5 site, I recently switched my personal webpage to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a tool that allows for static website development with no need for a database or content management system, based on the open-source [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. You can also find (and feel free to use) the code I deployed [here](https://github.com/ayshabkhan/ayshabkhan.github.io), although I'll note that I'm already looking at shifting over to [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a static website generator based in React.js.

Anyhow, this site is hosted on GitHub Pages and the home page image was shot by Sarah Dorweiler.

#### **Print design: Book covers, fliers and posters**

#### **Interactive storytelling: "Kickstarting Persian digital humanities"**

I wrote an article about a groundbreaking Persian digital humanities project and designed a [responsive webpage](http://www.jclass.umd.edu/652352/2015fall/lhoffmann/khan/index.html) with multimedia elements – original photography, a longform interview hosted on Soundcloud, and an interactive map using the Storymap.js Javascript library –  built with HTML5 and CSS.

#### **Interactive storytelling: "Wander," a web presentation**

I also used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and a number of third-party APIs and Javascript libraries to create a responsive, interactive slideshow. You can see that [here](http://codepen.io/seemaysh/pen/jqGjWe).
