							<h1>Hi, I'm Aysha Khan.</h1>
								<p class="major">Iâ€™m a journalist fascinated by how people are working for justice, in ways large and small.

								<p>Currently I work as the managing editor at the nonprofit news site <a href="https://nextcity.org/">Next City</a> and as the deputy managing editor at nonprofit outlet <a href="https://analystnews.org/">Analyst News</a>. My background is in religion journalism: My in-depth coverage of American Muslim communities has been published by <a href="https://religionnews.com/author/akhan/">Religion News Service</a>, a nonprofit wire where I spent several years as a staff journalist, as well as in the Washington Post, Associated Press, Boston Globe and other national outlets.</p>

								<p>I hold degrees in journalism from the University of Maryland and in Islamic studies from Harvard Divinity School. I've been a fellow with the Solutions Journalism Network, International Center for Journalists, GroundTruth Project, Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, Muslim Women & the Media Training Institute, and Journalism & Women Symposium.</p>

							<h2>Reporting and writing</h2>
								<p>I've filed stories from London to Las Vegas, covering a Uyghur woman's <a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/02/13/a-daughters-duty-from-boston-a-uighur-woman-champions-her-fathers-release-in-china/">battle</a> to release her father from Chinese detention, how Muslim app developers see data privacy as <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2021/06/16/app-data-collection-muslims-in-tech">an act of faith</a>, the Muslim women confronting <a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/01/15/a-long-time-coming-these-muslims-are-bringing-sex-abuse-by-sheikhs-out-of-the-shadows/">spiritual abuse</a>, and Pakistan's weaponization of its <a href="https://religionnews.com/2021/01/13/pakistan-attempts-to-prosecute-ahmadi-us-citizens-for-digital-blasphemy-980-1000/">blasphemy laws</a> against minority Muslims in the U.S.</p>
