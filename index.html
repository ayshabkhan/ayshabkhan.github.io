							<h1>Hi, I'm Aysha Khan.</h1>
								<p class="major">I’m a journalist based in Boston. My work examines religion, digital culture and underrepresented communities &mdash; with a focus on the lives of Muslims in America.</p>
								<p>These days I report on U.S. Muslims and millennial spirituality at <a href="http://religionnews.com">Religion News Service</a>, an award-winning, non-profit news wire that's partnered with the Associated Press. Some days I'm covering federal anti-extremism <a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/05/02/china-is-punishing-muslims-for-fasting-so-us-muslims-are-fasting-from-china/">programs</a>. Other times I'm writing about WhatsApp <a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/10/15/inside-the-whatsapp-group-of-young-muslims-praying-for-bernies-health/">prayer groups</a>, Muslim-led <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/05/16/ramadan-bail-prison-zakat/">bail</a> funds, and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/05/02/china-is-punishing-muslims-for-fasting-so-us-muslims-are-fasting-from-china/">boycotts</a> of Chinese goods over the country's detention of Muslims.</p>

								<p>I've held fellowships with the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, UC Davis' Muslim Women & the Media Training Institute, and the Journalism & Women Symposium. My reporting has won awards from the South Asian Journalists Association and the Religion News Association.</p>
