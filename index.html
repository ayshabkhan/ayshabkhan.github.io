							<h1>Hi, I'm Aysha Khan.</h1>
								<p class="major">I’m a journalist in Boston. My work examines religion, digital culture and minority communities &mdash; with a main focus on the lives of Muslims in America.</p>
								<p>I report on U.S. Muslims and millennial spirituality at <a href="http://religionnews.com">Religion News Service</a>, a non-profit news wire partnered with the Associated Press. I've filed stories from London to Las Vegas, covering federal anti-extremism <a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/08/30/as-progressives-propose-reviving-a-federal-anti-extremism-campaign-the-controversial-program-continues-to-divide-muslims/">programs</a>, Muslim women <a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/01/15/a-long-time-coming-these-muslims-are-bringing-sex-abuse-by-sheikhs-out-of-the-shadows/">confronting</a> spiritual abuse and a Uighur woman's <a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/02/13/a-daughters-duty-from-boston-a-uighur-woman-champions-her-fathers-release-in-china/">battle</a> to release her father from Chinese imprisonment.</p>

								<p>I've held fellowships with the GroundTruth Project, the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, Muslim Women & the Media Training Institute, and Journalism & Women Symposium. My reporting has won awards from the South Asian Journalists Association and the Religion News Association.</p>
