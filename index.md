I’m a journalist and web producer based just outside Baltimore. My work focuses on religion, underrepresented communities, technology and the intersections therein. Usually that means covering Muslim American issues and experiences, or exploring cool ways techies and artists are pushing society forward.

My reporting has been published in The Washington Post, USA Today, ThinkProgress, American Journalism Review, Sojourners and other outlets. (Find my clips [here](http://aysha.us/bylines/).) Sometimes I do web design, social media, data visualization and graphics, too, so if you want you can call me a digital journalist. (My web portfolio is [here](http://aysha.us/digital/).)

I’ve worked at the Religion News Service, The Tempest, and the Journalism Center on Children and Families. I recently graduated from the University of Maryland, where I studied multiplatform journalism and Middle Eastern affairs. There, I ran [Plex](https://medium.com/umdplex), an independent, award-winning student news site highlighting diversity and activism.

In particular, I’m actively looking for opportunities to expand my portfolio of writing in the following beats: digital culture, cybersecurity, mass and targeted surveillance, civic technology and activism, South Asian culture and religion, Muslim American issues and sectarianism in Islam.

Now that you’ve made it this far…here are a few things I’m particularly proud of writing:

- For ThinkProgress, I wrote nearly 3,500 words analyzing the [future of federal transparency](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-government-transparency-d3b8c2c44c3b) under the Trump administration. 
- For Religion News Service, I explored the targeted [harassment and trolling visibly Muslim women face](http://religionnews.com/2016/06/28/muslim-women-online-cyber-harassment/) online. 
- For The Tempest, I [interviewed Sebastian Jones](https://thetempest.co/2015/10/31/entertainment/niobe-bringing-badass-girls-comics/?hvid=vanH2), who along with actress Amandla Stenberg co-wrote the first nationally distributed comic with both a black female author and a black female artist.
